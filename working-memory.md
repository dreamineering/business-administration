Email is open-loop communication

Time of day for deep work
time of day for tasks
time of day for clients

Why wait until the end of the day to do your business admin? Isn't this time when CEOs of other businesses have time available for treatment?

Use structured communication to create better work patterns for greater efficiency.

Get to the money person.
