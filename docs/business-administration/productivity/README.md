# Productivity

Planning, communication and accountability.

Time is your greatest asset, never undervalue it. In a small practice owners need to remember they are managing a business, not working in a job. So management of all aspects of the business should carry equal weight with quality of treatment. It can be argued that this is also a very common reason for business failure: The owner is more comfortable "doing" and so ignores other important aspects of management.
