# Finances

Most business plans concentrate on this area because they need loans or investment, as well as for forecasting and budgeting purposes. Since money is the blood that keeps a business alive, a business operator should always know how healthy he or she is financially. This requires a realistic prediction of cash flow, even though it can be difficult to forecast the future. To do so, a planner should form an expenditure budget and then a picture of potential revenue. Much of this information can be found by studying similar businesses and adapting their information to the new business.
