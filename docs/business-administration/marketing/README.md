# Marketing

Since marketing and sales will generate revenue, planners should also thoroughly understand their potential customers and determine how they will reach them. Most new business operators mistakenly use an "inside-out" approach to marketing in that they plan their product or service first and then look for some way to sell it to a vaguely defined group that is "out there."

However this "build it and they will come" approach usually results in much wasted effort, fierce competition from others who have the same idea and, often, failure. Before designing a product or service, business operators should study the market and assess the needs of customers. Find underserved areas. Then shape the marketing of the product or service, and sometimes the product or service itself, to answer those needs.
