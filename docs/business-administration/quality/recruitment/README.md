# Recruitment

A common mistake planners make is to stop at the financial aspect of hiring staff. Of equal concern should be the ability to hire, and whether those hired fit the roles for which they are chosen. For example, some industries are facing acute labour shortages. Therefore the planner may have to understand what attracts workers, and offer them what they want. Today, managers must treat employees like customers, with the same understanding of what motivates their behaviour.
