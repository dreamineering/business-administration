# Create a Cashflow Forecast

The initial goal is not perfection, something you can continually improve.

> Plans are of little importance, but planning is essential - Winston Churchill

The true value of your forecast is not in the numbers but the critical thinking in considering goals, obstacles and tasks that must be navigated to steer results towards expectations. **Don't think of this as static file to be completed and left aside**, instead return frequently to tweak and create different scenarios that fit with your options for growth.

As you understand your business better and establish good habits so to will your ability to predict the future profits related to plans for expansion.

## General Approach

Replace items in brackets, such as {clinican one} with actual staff names if you are looking to employ new staff, use a convention to create a holder name until the recruitment process is complete.

A key assumption is that your service price list will be reviewed quarterly.

## Pricing

Replace the names of services, with the actual services and prices you offer and those of your competition for sake of quarterly comparison and update.

For each service consider whether you can differentiate via marketing and new pricing band, if a clinician with 20+ years of experience is charging at the same rate as recent graduate.

These numbers do not automatically feed into other sheets in this workbook. But you will need to reference this sheet when estimating the maximum hourly rate of each clinician could earn, assuming 100% (Saturation) time is spent with a paying client.

## Scheduled Hours

For each clinician replace the starting values {clinician one} then month by month enter the expected. If you intend to recruit add ghost profiles based on their role.

- scheduled hours
- admin (in-service) hours
- leave hours
- worst and best case saturation expectations, based on demand
  - experience
  - expertise
  - specialisation
  - network

## Cashflow

Start with expenditure as this is easiest. Potential revenue is more subjective and dependent on your strategic goal are driven by greater efficiency or growth.

When estimating sales revenue, consider the Worst case scenario first as a [fear setting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7EVMjgsSME) exercise to help reduce the anxiety that is preventing decisive action.

For revenue Clinician's name as you did in Scheduled Hours, but repeat an entry for each important revenue channel you are interested in for evaluating worst and best case revenue is to ensure each clinician has a total adding up to 100%.

Think of different services/pricing bands that each clinician provides treatment for, then create a line in the sales section for each service type and pricing band.

Steps

1. Match Clinicians in Schedule
2. Create worst and best-case scenarios for what percentage of time each clinician spends performing each service. As an example you would want to limit the percentage of time an Clinician of 20 years spends peforming low priced insurance work.
3. Enter the worst and best case ratio and an averaged hourly rate based on the quarter

_GPM service will automatically be calculated based on the total providers scheduled hours._

## Clinical Expertise

Review quarterly to help understand where training gaps are in your practice's quality of service

## Operations

1. Create a breakdown of Jobs by [Business Operations](../../operations/) that your admin team perform
2. For each job and staff member [Blockout Time](../../operations/productivity/time-blocking.md) for a month
3. Enter best and worst case hourly rates when 100% booked with clients
4. Enter best and worst case hourly rates for outsource this work.

Most relevant where the businesses is driving the owner rather than the other way round. Specifically where an owner is wearing too many hats rather than outsourcing work to people that don't cost as much and often will have better skills to complete the required job.

The key to outsourcing success is knowing what to expect and how to enforce accountability for outsourced work.

- What is the Opportunity cost of not delegating work effectively?
- Where are the knowledge gaps in your business admin team?

## Strategic Questions

Review for what you want out of transitioning to another software solution and as part of a quarterly management review, judge progress and set strategy for the next quarter.

## Property

Easy proximity to your primary customer profile is essential, but at what cost?

- Are you getting value for money?
- Is your location handy to your target customers?
- Do you have a property manager you trust?

## Benchmark Wages

Refer to this sheet when estimating the cost of employing new staff to cover specific roles

## History

Extract from your Practice Management system.
