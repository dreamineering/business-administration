# Fundamentals

If you don't achieve operational consistency across your team, measuring the impact of your strategic direction is guesswork. Discover what you need to learn, make a list, tick items off, grow your knowledge, then [create checklists](../../functionality/workflows/checklists/) to share that knowledge efficiently.

> Created disciplined routines to drive operational consistency

## Goals

- Adapt to new workflows and ideas
- Establish routines when and why reports must be run.

Review the [fundamentals](../fundamentals/) to running a successful business for ideas on how you can improve.
