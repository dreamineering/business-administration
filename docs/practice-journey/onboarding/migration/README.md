# Migration

It is important to note that it is your responsibility to request data from your current supplier.

For more specific details on what to request refer to the list of options below.

- [Cliniko](./migrate-to-gensolve-from-cliniko.md)
- [TM2/3](./migrate-to-gensolve-from-tm3.md)
- [Wintaps](./migrate-to-gensolve-from-wintaps.md)
- [Houston](./migrate-to-gensolve-from-houston.md)
- [Peak](./migrate-to-gensolve-from-peak.md)
- [Frontdesk](./migrate-to-gensolve-from-frontdesk.md)

As a standard best practice process we strongly recommmed making two seperate requests for data dumps.

The first data dump is imported into parallel migration approval environment for the sole purpose of running through a [migration checklist](./migration-approval-checklist) together to ensure data is accurately appearing in GPM.

The second request is for data you will go Live with.

## Timeline

1. Request Approval data dump
2. Transfer approval data
3. Run Approval checklist migrations
4. Request Live data dump
5. Run Live migration
6. Run post migration data integrity checks
