# Installation

If you are currently running a small practice, the first sight of GPM may leave you feeling a little overwhelmed and appear to have functionality that is far more complex than you need.

> At it's basic core, GPM is very effective at allowing you to quickly manage your diary, make the most of your time in front of clients, and then make sure you get paid for the time spent providing treatment.

Do not worry it is very natural, particularly if business training has not been part of your professional curriculum. We will work with you to create a user role that suits your day to day needs. But you will always have access to the entire system. As your knowledge and practice grows along with the recognition that additonal functionality is required, you can alter or add new roles as you need leverage more of what Gensolve Practice Manager has to offer.
