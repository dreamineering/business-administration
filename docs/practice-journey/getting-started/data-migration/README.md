# Data Migration

This is the process of getting your current supplier to extract your data, transfer that over to us so we can run the migration logic to setup your organisation.

Below is indicator of a baseline critical path, dependent of workloads to respective parties, however some sytems are much easier than others. **Note - we cannot confirm a GO LIVE date until your team confirms the migration logic is correct**. The items in bold below are your responsibility of your team.
