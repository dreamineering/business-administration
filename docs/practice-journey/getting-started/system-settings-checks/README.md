# System Settings Checks

Your system will come loaded with an onboarding checklist of options you can set to fully customise GPM to your needs.

Some of these tasks are vital to be ready to fully operations on **Go Live** day, others are simply so your practice manager has a basic knowledge of what is possible and know where to look for help when the time is right to make further customisations. This list will be reviewed with a Gensolve onboarding expert, before and after completion to clear up any questions.
