## First Impressions

_WARNING_ If you currently run a small practice, when you log into GPM with administrative rights you may feel a little overwhelmed and consider GPM is more complex than you need. That is natural reaction, particularly if business administration has not been part of your professional curriculum. Rest assured that it's basic core GPM is intuitive and very effective at allowing you to quickly manage your diary, make the most of your time in front of clients, and then make sure you get paid for the time spent providing treatment.

During the **onboarding process** we will work with you to tailor a user role that suits your day to day needs. You will always have access to the entire system that you can largely ignore, But as your knowledge and your practice grows you will begin to recognise that additonal functionality is required, and then you can simply alter or add new roles as required to leverage more of what Gensolve Practice Manager has to offer.
