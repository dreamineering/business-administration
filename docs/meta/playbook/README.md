- How we operate
- How to use GPM to drive Gensolve's Operations
- How Gensolve Develops Software

## Goal

Predictable, Repeatable Growth that is not reliant on any particular Knowledge Worker so that Gensolve can [scale](https://mastersofscale.com/) at the optimum rate, avoiding unproductive, morale destroying **Fire-Fighting**.

Evolve Genolve's **why** through using GPM to optimise internal business operations so that we can evole and pass on value creating [workflows](../../features/workflows/) ideas to our customers.

> The **Meta** of the **Matter** is where the **Value** lies
