## Goal

Predictable, Repeatable Growth that is not reliant on any particular Knowledge Worker so that Gensolve can [scale](https://mastersofscale.com/) at the optimum rate, avoiding unproductive, morale destroying **Fire-Fighting - Endless cycles of rework**.

Evolve Genolve's **why** through using GPM to optimise internal business operations so that we can evolve and pass on value-creating [workflows](../../features/workflows/) ideas to our customers.

A clear cut process that explains how features are prioritised across all products and countries
