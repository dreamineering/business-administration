## Goals

1. Predictable Growth through building a Sales Engine
2. Greater Product Knowledge, laser focus on adding value
3. Process Optimisation, eliminate rework
4. Documented Framework for Decision Prioritisation

Predictable, Repeatable Growth that is not reliant on any particular Knowledge Worker so that Gensolve can [scale](https://mastersofscale.com/) at the optimum rate, avoiding unproductive, morale destroying **Fire-Fighting - Endless cycles of rework**.

> Feel the pain of using our product to run our own business so that we have a laser focus on what needed to run an appointment based revenue business more efficiently.

Optimise internal business operations so that we pass on valuable [workflow](/features/workflows/) ideas to our customers.

A clear cut process that explains how features are prioritised across all products and countries

## Sales

Gensolve flies in the face of common startup wisdom (dogma), focus on one thing and do that one thing exceptionally well. But is it a product problem? Or the fact it is very hard to sell the benefits of problem solutions to customers that don't have the fundamental business knowledge to recognise there is a problem.
