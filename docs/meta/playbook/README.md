## Goals

1. Predictable Growth through building a Sales Engine
2. Greater Product Knowledge, laser focus on adding value
3. Process Optimisation, eliminate rework
4. Documented Framework for Decision Prioritisation

Predictable, Repeatable Growth that is not reliant on any particular Knowledge Worker so that Gensolve can [scale](https://mastersofscale.com/) at the optimum rate, avoiding unproductive, morale destroying **Fire-Fighting - Endless cycles of rework**.

> Feel the pain of using our product to run our own business so that we have a laser focus on what needed to run an appointment based revenue business more efficiently.

Optimise internal business operations so that we pass on valuable [workflow](/features/workflows/) ideas to our customers.

A clear cut process that explains how features are prioritised across all products and countries
