# Playbook

- How we operate
- How to use GPM to drive Gensolve's Operations
- How Gensolve Develops Software

They say that when writing a novel you should write the ending first. If we apply this thinking to the story of our customers. What is their end goal/legacy of running their business? In other words, what is the desired exit?

## Goal

Predictable, Repeatable Growth that is not reliant on any particular Knowledge Worker so that Gensolve can [scale](https://mastersofscale.com/) at the optimum rate, avoiding unproductive, morale destroying **Fire-Fighting - Endless cycles of rework**.

Evolve Genolve's **why** through using GPM to optimise internal business operations so that we can evolve and pass on value-creating [workflows](../../features/workflows/) ideas to our customers.

A clear cut process that explains how features are prioritised across all products and countries

## If it is written down, it doesn't exist

- [Executive perspective](https://www.chiefexecutiveboards.com/briefings/briefing210.htm)
- [Coding perspective](https://blog.codinghorror.com/if-it-isnt-documented-it-doesnt-exist/)

Good process starts with writing. If you want a duplication machine, you must have great processes! All of the Gensolve team need to be contributing freely, without friction as much as they can.
