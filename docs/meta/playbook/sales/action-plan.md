## Surface Pros with GPM Installed

We need to address the perception that an iPad is **the tablet** and [sell the benefits of Surface for Notes](https://business-administration.now.sh/growth/quality/treatment-notes-with-surface.html)

We could buy Surface Pros with lowest required spec and deliver it to

### Chews Health

[Jack Chew](https://twitter.com/JackAChew) of [Chews Health]() who runs the [Physio Matters Podcast](https://twitter.com/TPMPodcast) over 20k followers on Twitter.

We can ask him to review and rate GPM's _with customer experience_ when taking notes.

The benefit is that this podcast is purely treatment-related and Jack hosts many other Physios to talk about treatment matters so if he has a surface there is a chance he will show others.

Hi - I would be most grateful if you could provide with the following information:

1. Cost of your programme per clinic/per practitioner
2. Can we use an IPad/Tablet to "hand write" case notes using a ipen - **same Apple Mentality Paul had**

I spoke to Gerry and she was on her way to a lecture and she said she would check GPM out, however very busy.

It would be great to call and say hey we'd like to send you a surface pro so you can try things out and make a more informed decison without any upfront costs.

If you download the budget from the home page you will see I have been factoring this into the CashflowÂ Budgeting tool so we can take the lead on helping the buyer to understand GPM's value proposition.

_Can get Pauls backing but would be great to get AUT_

## Other Ideas

**The greatest value of the KPIs work was to drive Gensolve's sales**. So the content and the budgeting tool you find here is about explaining that, and how we can use both to penetrate the UK (future) markets. In short use KPIs to prove value the proposition by tying results to a forecast.

The key point is that we have to start using GPM ourselves to drive internal operations and improve our marketing messaging by **scratching your own itch** How can you expect to sell the virtues of a system that solves all kinds of problems Gensolve needs to solve, when don't even believe in your product enough to use it yourselves? By **feeling the customer's pain** where things don't work as smoothly will improve product workflows and reduce the demands on the QA team, making releases less stressful.

For example, just imagine if you had spent the last two years and the money on HubSpot instead using GPM and improving the marketing experience and marketing content in GPM. You just need to spend 10 mins listenning to the crowded market of would-be business advisors to understand the value of this to your potential sales.
