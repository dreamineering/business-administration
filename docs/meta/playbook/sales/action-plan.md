## Send a Surface Pro to Chews Health

We need to address the perception that an iPad is **the tablet**.

Buy a surface pro with lowest required spec and deliver it to [Jack Chew](https://twitter.com/JackAChew) of
[Chews Health]() who runs the [Physio Matters Podcast](https://twitter.com/TPMPodcast) over 20k followers on Twitter.

We can ask him to review and rate GPM's _with customer experience_ when taking notes.

The benefit is that this podcast is purely treatment-related and Jack hosts many other Physios to talk about treatment matters so if he has a surface there is a chance he will show others.
