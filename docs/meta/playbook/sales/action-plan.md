# Action Plan

[[toc]]

## Send a Surface Pro

### Chews Health

We need to address the perception that an iPad is **the tablet**.

Buy a surface pro with lowest required spec and deliver it to [Jack Chew](https://twitter.com/JackAChew) of
[Chews Health]() who runs the [Physio Matters Podcast](https://twitter.com/TPMPodcast) over 20k followers on Twitter.

We can ask him to review and rate GPM's _with customer experience_ when taking notes.

The benefit is that this podcast is purely treatment-related and Jack hosts many other Physios to talk about treatment matters so if he has a surface there is a chance he will show others.

Hi - I would be most grateful if you could provide with the following information:

1. Cost of your programme per clinic/per practitioner
2. Can we use an IPad/Tablet to "hand write" case notes using a ipen - **same Apple Mentality Paul had**

I spoke to Gerry and she was on her way to a lecture and she said she would check GPM out, however very busy.

It would be great to call and say hey we'd like to send you a surface pro so you can try things out and make a more informed decison without any upfront costs.

If you download the budget from the home page you will see I have been factoring this into the CashflowÂ Budgeting tool so we can take the lead on helping the buyer to understand GPM's value proposition.

_Can get Pauls backing but would be great to get AUT_

## Other Ideas

As you might remember I've always said **the most important thing about the work on the KPI Dashboards was to drive Gensolve's sales**. So this is what this content and the budgeting tool is about, and is the fruition of the ideas I explained to Jamie about how we need to approach penetrating the UK market. In short use KPIs to prove value the proposition. But a key to that is to show how to make a budget.

Unfortunately, we did not follow the first step of the plan of spending three months on development work on **healthcode** to get UKs biggest physio provider who was all over us four years ago, and would have shot GPM to the top of the credibility chain. Do you remember saying _"we won't repeat the Australia insurance billing mistakes?"_ Andy Hosgood confirmed also this would be a vital cog in strategy to gain acceptance in the UK. To be clear, **I am not holding the Colombian team to blame for this**. From my expeience you have never really been in a position to support UK development. But I also see this country centric approach as extremely flawed.

The key point I tried to make four years ago, **that I am still trying to make** is that you guys would do your internal operations and reporting and product development the world of good if you just started showing some love for the system you developed of the past 18 years by using it and backing up the message you are trying to promote with real experience of **scratching your own itch**

How can you expect to sell the virtues of system that solves all kinds of problems you need to solve, when don't even believe in your product enough to use it yourselves? And **really feel the customer's pain** where things don't work as smoothly as the could.

Imagine if you had just spend two years and the money you spent on HubSpot with using GPM and improving the marketing workflows....

Before you leave BH I expect to have **written clarity** from your perspective:

1. What the strategy is
2. What plans for next quarter
3. What are expected results
