# Customer Problems

Enter as Injuries in Gensolve Operations

## Listen to the market

Listen to these podcasts, particularly episodes with customer testimonials to hear the **Pain Points** or **Problems** in the customer's words.

The point is not to attempt to gain revenue via coaching but to explain to our customers how they can use GPM to apply what they learning about.

The advantage Gensolve has on the proliferation of coaches is that their product is largely just words and they are leveraging knowledge transfer and time, not a truly actionable closed-loop system.

## What are the most undervalued/differentiating features?
