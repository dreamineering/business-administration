# Hands off Demo

1. Use the system
2. Load new data from spreadsheets
3. Leverage G2G migration logic

## Migration Tool

Explain work that has been done to load up Organisation with Demo Scenarios

1. We need to create characters with scenarios to walk through
2. Providers that represent different modalities

## Demo Scenarios

- The solo owner/operator (easiest)
- The multi-modality site
- The multi vendor (audience accountants)

## Capture Feedback

We can use our event system
[Customer Problems](./customer-problems.md) use demo to capture [feedback](../../demo/profiles/feedback-quesitons.md) to help generate a standard list.
