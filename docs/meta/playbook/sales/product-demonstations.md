Nobody does, we need to enable prospective customers to look around in their own free time.

Enable prospects to start using the application and try various workflows using login roles that are aligned with common business functions.

## Goals

Enable prospective customers to have rewarding self-discovery tours of Gensolve applications free from the pressures of dealing with a salesperson.

Use the Migration Tool to create a consistent staging experience in preparedness for running product demonstrations. Be they guided by a Gensolve employee or self-discovery by prospective customers.

The logic and process could also help save our **QA team** time so they can test required actions rather than waste time with manual entry of staging requirements.

1. Use the system
2. Load new data from spreadsheets
3. Leverage G2G migration logic

## Migration Tool

Explain work that has been done to load up Organisation with Demo Scenarios

1. We need to create characters with scenarios to walk through
2. Providers that represent different modalities

## Demo Scenarios

- The solo owner/operator (easiest)
- The multi-modality site
- The multi vendor (audience accountants)

## Capture Feedback

We can use our event system
[Customer Problems](./customer-problems.md) use demo to capture [feedback](../../demo/profiles/feedback-quesitons.md) to help generate a standard list.

Overview of Demo
To showcase GPM to a potential client in the best light for them
Demo Process
Call the potential client to book the Demo this gives you the opportunity prior to the Demo day to see what they practice and what their practice is like.
You can then book in the Demo with a Gotomeeting ad sent through an email with the meeting link
Set up your Demo GPM to have information in it that is relevant to that Client
Approx an hour out from doing the Demo send an email to remind them that you are about to do the Demo along with the Meeting link and time again
At the start of the Demo introduce yourself and ask the names of the attendees and what they do as there could be more than 1 (I always try to encourage more as it gets everyone involved and excited for the potential change)
Then ask if they have an agenda of items that they wanted to cover off on before you begin so that you can cover their key points first and then show them a bit of an overview of the other areas that they may not have mentioned
Include everyone in on the conversations IE: if you are asked about Appointment booking ask the Admin staff what / how they would do the process after showing them how you have just done it
In conclusion, if there are many staff in attendance I would not discuss price other than to say that you will send through a proposal to the Owner and give them a personal call as well to cover off on this. If it is just the Owner or Project manager attending then the price is an open discussion.
