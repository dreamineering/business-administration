# Product Demonstrations

> Do you like salespeople coming up to you when you first go into a shop?

Nobody does, we need to enable prospective customers to look around in their own free time.

Enable prospects to start using the application and try various workflows using login roles that are aligned with common business functions.

## Goals

Enable prospective customers to have rewarding self-discovery tours of Gensolve applications free from the pressures of dealing with a salesperson.

Use the Migration Tool to create a consistent staging experience in preparedness for running product demonstrations. Be they guided by a Gensolve employee or self-discovery by prospective customers.

The logic and process could also help save our **QA team** time so they can test required actions rather than waste time with manual entry of staging requirements.

1. Use the system
2. Load new data from spreadsheets
3. Leverage G2G migration logic

## Migration Tool

Explain work that has been done to load up Organisation with Demo Scenarios

1. We need to create characters with scenarios to walk through
2. Providers that represent different modalities

## Demo Scenarios

- The solo owner/operator (easiest)
- The multi-modality site
- The multi vendor (audience accountants)

## Capture Feedback

We can use our event system
[Customer Problems](./customer-problems.md) use demo to capture [feedback](../../demo/profiles/feedback-quesitons.md) to help generate a standard list.
