# Sales

Using GPM and Gensolve Operations to create a **data-driven** sales process to track how many are coming in, how good are we at converting.

## Problems

1. **No Funnel!!!**
2. No Sales process
3. Siloed knowledge

The Product team can have a masssive impact on adding features that help to optimise the funnel. Everyone should spend some time on site using the software to help run a business for a customer.

We can use client groups in GPM to track progress through the funnel

## Goals

Repeatable growth process

1. What is working well, and what needs to be improved?
2. What levers should be focused on to drive the business?
3. Hit the accelerator, or the brakes?
4. Impact on cash and profit/loss of hitting the accelerator?

## Customers

Adoption with high rewards (business benefit) for low effort and talent.

- Negate fear of transition
- Negate talent
- Limit effort to estabilsh good habits

### Customer Problems

[Customer Problems](./customer-problems.md) use demo to capture [feedback](../../demo/profiles/feedback-quesitons.md) to help generate a standard list.

## Desired Outcomes

1. Acquire Customers
2. Retain Customers
3. Monetize Customers

## How

Use a spreadsheet. Simplification of spreadsheet I created as Project Manager to sell OSS/DSS to telecoms where the target customer was CFO, the reasons being either:

1. Employees knew there was a problem but did not know how to tell the money story.
2. Managers did not want to be exposed as performing poorly

The method revolved around a quesitonnaire to get find out certain KPI benchmarks and then extrapolating value. Sales process was slow and complex by comparison but the audience was both tech and financially sophisticated which helped.

![Sales Process](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13bo-97_8twxsiWxhM7riatQ7pVgNTXtU)

The result was a cash flow and speculative **Net Present Value** gains.

The complexity for GPM is effort to setup an organisation well and the relative tech and business knowledge of our target market.

### Onboarding is Key

Scoring onboarding success is critical to creating a Virtuous Circle to get faster payoff on Customer Acquistion Cost by proving Business Benefits while the customer is open to listenning to advice.

We have to do everything we can to ensure customers achieve **and understand** full business benefits of using Gensolve to run their business at lowest possible cost to us.
