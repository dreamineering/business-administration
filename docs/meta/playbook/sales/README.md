# Sales

Using GPM and Gensolve Operations to create a **data-driven** sales process to track how many are coming in, how good are we at converting.

## Problems

> Everyone in SaaS organisation needs to know how to contribute to the sales funnel

1. **No Lead Funnel**
2. Undocumented Sales process
3. Big system that nobody fully understands the benefits of
4. Siloed knowledge (answers in ZenDesk)

The Product team can have a massive impact on Sales by adding features that help to optimise the funnel. Everyone should spend some time onsite using the software to help run a business for a customer. Failing that **we have to eat our dog food** if we wish to build knowledge across the organisation and credibility with our target customers.

We can use client groups in GPM to track progress through the funnel

## Goals

Repeatable growth process

1. What is working well, and what needs to be improved?
2. What levers can drive growth in the business?
3. Hit the accelerator, or the brakes?
4. Impact on cash and profit/loss of hitting the accelerator?

## Customers

Adoption with high rewards (business benefit) for low effort and talent.

- Negate fear of transition
- Negate talent
- Limit effort to establish good habits

### Personas

Break the system into four business functional areas. With regards to Quality (Client Treatment) can further breakdown analysis by service [modality](./modalities.md).

### Customer Problems

[Customer Problems](./customer-problems.md) use demo to capture [feedback](../../demo/profiles/feedback-quesitons.md) to help generate a standard list.

![provide-feedback](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1OmnSOuWu5JwAVaY8u43XF1tW_7ZmXdxS)

## Desired Outcomes

1. Acquire Customers
2. Retain Customers
3. Monetize Customers

## How

1. Trogen Horse
2. Hands Off Product Demo
3. Onboarding Experience
4. Target Existing Relationships

### Trogen Horse

Use a spreadsheet we can send out and that can be further distributed to grow awareness. So we can:

1. Begin relationships by helping not selling
2. We learn more about buy triggers and where to focus product improvement
3. We don't waste time trying to make the wrong customer happy

Can simplify for Solopreneurs.

### Hands Off Product Demo

Enable prospects to start using the application and try various workflows using login roles that are aligned with common business functions.

### Onboarding Experience

Scoring onboarding success is critical to creating a Virtuous Circle to get faster payoff on Customer Acquisition Cost by proving the Business Benefits while the customer is open to listening to advice.

The complexity for GPM is effort to set-up an organisation well and the relative tech and business knowledge of our target market. A lot of the complexity, effort to configure the system has been absorbed into the Migration Tool (But we should of this code in the main app)

We have to do everything we can to ensure customers achieve **and understand** full business benefits of using Gensolve to run their business at the lowest possible onboarding cost.

Prove value

![forecast-control-loop](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-l5lH6YCThCioOAAmuJJQEp15LQPqknz)

### Target Existing Relationships

- The accountant will have trust
- Accountants can give quality product feedback

## Persuasion

Answer **How much money are you losing?** by quantifying Job to be done, **value stories** by business discipline, Finance, Quality, Productivity and Marketing. See the performance spreadsheet for an example of Productivity and File Management.
