# Sales

Gensolve flies in the face of common startup wisdom (dogma), focus on one thing and do that one thing exceptionally well.

But is it really a product problem? Or the fact it is very hard to sell the benefits of solutions to problems to customers can't recognise there is a problem.

Using GPM and Gensolve Operations to create a **data-driven** sales process to track how many are coming in, how good are we at converting.

Disruption (I prefer Dreamineering) is ability to create a new market where there are no competitors. This is an opportunity Gensolve has if you free yourself from thinking of the product through its graphical interface.

## Questions

- What do [these guys](./business-advisors.md) have that we don't?
- What do we have that they don't?
- What problems do we have in common with our customers?

## Desired Outcomes

> Everyone in our organisation knows how to contribute to the sales funnel and how they will be **rewarded** for their efforts

1. Acquire Customers
2. Retain Customers
3. Monetize Customers

## Problems

1. **No Lead Funnel**
2. Undocumented Sales process
3. Gensolve is **BIG** system that nobody fully understands the benefits of
4. Siloed knowledge (answers in ZenDesk)

The Product team can have a massive impact on Sales by adding features that help to optimise the funnel. Everyone should spend some time onsite using the software to help run a business for a customer. Failing that **we have to eat our dog food** if we wish to build knowledge across the organisation and credibility with our target customers.

We can use client groups in GPM to track progress through the funnel

## Goals

An [onboarding process](./onboarding/) second to none across any SaaS solution.

Repeatable growth process

1. What is working well, and what needs to be improved?
2. What levers can drive growth in the business?
3. Hit the accelerator or the brakes?
4. Impact on cash and profit/loss of hitting the accelerator?

## Customers

Adoption with high rewards (business benefit) for low effort and talent.

- The tendency to see business as a necessary evil
- Negate fear of transition
- Negate talent
- Limit effort to establish good habits

## How

1. [Trogen Horse to close the value loop](./performance-spreadsheet.md)
2. [Hands Off Product Demo](./hands-off-demo.md)
3. [Onboarding Experience](./onboarding.md)
4. [Target Existing Relationships](./market.md)
5. [Create insiders](./insiders.md)

### Trogen Horse

Use a spreadsheet we can send out and that can be further distributed to grow awareness. So we can:

1. Begin relationships by helping not selling
2. We learn more about buy triggers and where to focus product improvement
3. We don't waste time trying to make the wrong customer happy

### Hands Off Product Demo

> Do you like salespeople coming up to you when you first go into a shop?

Nobody does, we need to enable prospective customers to look around in their own free time.

Enable prospects to start using the application and try various workflows using login roles that are aligned with common business functions.

### Onboarding Experience

Scoring [onboarding success](./onboarding.md) is critical to creating a Virtuous Circle to get faster payoff on Customer Acquisition Cost by proving the Business Benefits while the customer is open to listening to advice.

A lot of the complexity and effort to configure the system has been absorbed into the Migration Tool.

We have to do everything we can to ensure customers achieve **and understand** full business benefits of using Gensolve to run their business at the lowest possible onboarding cost.
