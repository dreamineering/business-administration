# Playbook > Sales

Gensolve flies in the face of common startup wisdom (dogma), focus on one thing and do that one thing exceptionally well. But is it a product problem? Or the fact it is very hard to sell the benefits of problem solutions to customers that can't recognise there is a problem.

> A complaint is a gift. Don't attempt to sell features. Empathise with problems and guide to the value of solutions.

Using GPM and Gensolve Operations to create a **data-driven** sales process to track how many are coming in, how good are we at converting and ensure new customers have an exceptional onboarding experience. Raising new customer's operational IQ in a matter of weeks.

Disruption is the ability to create a new market where there are no competitors. This is an opportunity Gensolve has if you free yourself from thinking of the product through its graphical interface.

## Questions

- What do [these guys](/growth/business-advisors.md) have that we don't?
- What do we have that they don't?
- What problems do we have in common with our customers?

## Desired Outcomes

> Everyone in our organisation knows how to contribute to the sales funnel and how they will be **rewarded** for their efforts

1. Acquire Customers
2. Retain Customers
3. Monetize Customers

## Problems

1. **No Lead Funnel**
2. Undocumented Sales process
3. Gensolve is **BIG** system that nobody fully understands the benefits of
4. Siloed knowledge (answers in ZenDesk)

The Product team can have a massive impact on Sales by adding features that help to optimise the funnel. Everyone should spend some time onsite using the software to help run a business for a customer. Failing that **we have to eat our dog food** if we wish to build knowledge across the organisation and credibility with our target customers.
