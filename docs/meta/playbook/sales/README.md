# Sales

Using GPM and Gensolve Operations to create a **data-driven** sales process to track how many are coming in, how good are we at converting.

## Problems

> Everyone in SaaS organisation needs to know how to contribute to the sales funnel

1. **No Lead Funnel**
2. Undocumented Sales process
3. Siloed knowledge (including ZenDesk)

The Product team can have a massive impact on Sales by adding features that help to optimise the funnel. Everyone should spend some time onsite using the software to help run a business for a customer. Failing that **we have to eat our dog food** if we wish to build knowledge across the organisation and credibility with our target customers.

We can use client groups in GPM to track progress through the funnel

## Goals

Repeatable growth process

1. What is working well, and what needs to be improved?
2. What levers can drive growth in the business?
3. Hit the accelerator, or the brakes?
4. Impact on cash and profit/loss of hitting the accelerator?

## Customers

Adoption with high rewards (business benefit) for low effort and talent.

- Negate fear of transition
- Negate talent
- Limit effort to establish good habits

## Desired Outcomes

1. Acquire Customers
2. Retain Customers
3. Monetize Customers

## How

1. Trogen Horse
2. Hands Off Product Demo
3. Onboarding Experience
4. Target Practice Accountants

### Trogen Horse

As a Project Manager of Telco OSS/DSS projects I created a spreadsheet to support Pre Sales, targeting Chief Financial Officer to explain the opportunity cost of not using our software, the reasons being either:

1. Employees with Specific Domain Knowledge knew there was a problem but could not quantify the money story
2. Finance directors did not have sufficient Subject Matter knowledge to understand the problem
3. Middle managers did not want to have poor performance and lack of knowledge exposed

![Sales Process](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=13bo-97_8twxsiWxhM7riatQ7pVgNTXtU)

By comparison, the target buyer for GPM may not have Cashflow Forecast and are generally less sophisticated with appraising technology and financial implications to make decisions.

The bottom line to the CFO was to help prove the **Net Present Value** story. The greater value for Gensolve is to help educate prospective customers on how to evaluate Practice Management software. If they decide to go for another package that is still fine as:

1. We learn more about buy triggers and where we need to focus on product improvement
2. We don't waste time trying to make the wrong customer happy

### Hands Off Product Demo

Enable prospects to start using the application and try various workflows using login roles that are aligned with common business functions.

### Onboarding Experience

Scoring onboarding success is critical to creating a Virtuous Circle to get faster payoff on Customer Acquistion Cost by proving Business Benefits while the customer is open to listening to advice.

The complexity for GPM is effort to set-up an organisation well and the relative tech and business knowledge of our target market. A lot of the complexity, effort to configure the system has been absorbed into the Migration Tool (But we should of this code in the main app)

We have to do everything we can to ensure customers achieve **and understand** full business benefits of using Gensolve to run their business at lowest possible cost to us.
