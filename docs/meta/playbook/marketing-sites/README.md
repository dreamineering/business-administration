## Project Plan

Below is the “perfect scenario” timeline if content preparation and other demands allow.

It’s vital to set expectations of the job to be done and transparency on how to measure success.

Website Design and Development Project Plans should be divided into the following phases.

- Entry Level Website: 6 – 10 Weeks
- Basic Website: 8 – 12 Weeks
- Standard Website: 10 – 14 Weeks
- Advanced Website: 14 – 18 Weeks
- Enterprise Website: 18 – 24 Weeks

## Estimates

Estimates are based on:

- 3 Rounds of Revisions to design
- Reviews and Revisions are Provided within 3 Business Days from the client
- Content 100% Complete by Phase 4
- No additional functionality is added to the project mid-project
- Approvals received within 3 Business Days of Request
- Project Stays on Initial Timeline

Should project move off initial timeline for any reason, resource allocation will be interrupted and your project will be juggled within buffer space, vs. initial resource task and milestone plans

The Timeline for this Phase can take 10 (ten) business days minimum and unlimited time to complete depending on the clients response time, clarity, decisiveness, and the amount of rounds of changes included in their investment plan. The number one thing that can impact the timeline during the design phase is Not Providing Timely/Clear Revisions.

- 4 to 6 versions can be done in 11 – 20 business days
- 7 to 9 versions can be done in 21- 30 business days

Your Investment Plan Includes a Specific Number of Design Revisions (Standard is 3). If you require additional rounds of changes, you can easily add them to your plan for \$200 per revision

## 4 Development

Here is an overview of the basic development phase. (IF you have an intermediate or advanced website, this is where the custom coding for advanced functionality would be).

Slice all of your PSD Designs (PSD = Photoshop Designs)
Install Database, WP, Etc.

The Timeline for this Phase can take 15 (fifteen) business days minimum and unlimited time to complete depending on the clients response time, clarity, decisiveness, and the amount of custom designed pages or custom functionality included in their investment plan. The more custom design / custom designed pages and custom functionality you have, the longer the development phases. The kinds of things that will extent the development time and put you into a intermediate or advanced project timeline would be, ecommerce, membership systems, forums, reservations systems, listing systems, directories, mapping functionality, etc.

\*Your Investment Plan Includes a Specific Number of Development Revisions (standard is 3). If you require additional rounds of changes, you can easily add them to your plan for \$200 per revision.

## 5 - Content

This phase can be one of the most difficult to predict time. When you are planning on a new website design and development project – do not forget to set aside a budget specifically for CONTENT. This is the most underbid part of a web project and one of the most important elements. It can cause the largest delays and if not done correctly, the most missed opportunities with a new website.

The entire Content Transfer, Creation and Management process will depend on the level of your SEO investment and goals. The more aggressive you are about placement, the more products and services you want to be found for and the more locations you want to be found in will DRAMATICALLY increase the time necessary for this phase.
