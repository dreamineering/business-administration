# Release Planning

No more thinking of the product along Country or Windows v Web!!!

- Put place work into best workflows to give job context
- Have workflow owners, but not exclusive developers
- Owners of workflows should have Figma accounts
- Get faster better feedback from Customers prior to scheduling
- Educate/manipulate it so that Customer requests have workflows as an owner
