# Release Planning

## Problems

- The product so big it takes a long time to understand all functionality.
- Who cries last and loudest is not a way to run operations

## Goals

No more thinking of the product along Country or Windows v Web! Use [workflows](https://www.intercom.com/blog/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/) to understand how feature connect customers to product benefits.

- Remove Silos
- Put place work into best workflows to give job context
- Have workflow owners, but not exclusive developers
- Owners of workflows should have Figma accounts
- Get faster better feedback from Customers prior to scheduling
- Educate/manipulate it so that Customer requests have workflows as an owner
