## Questions

- What are the most valuable problems?
- How to test Riskiest Assumptions?
- Do we have resources?

## Goals

No more thinking of the product along Country or Windows v Web! Use [workflows](https://www.intercom.com/blog/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/) to understand how a feature connects customers to product benefits.

- Remove Silos
- Put place work into best workflows to give job context
- Have workflow owners, but not exclusive developers
- Owners of workflows should have Figma accounts
- Get faster better feedback from Customers before coding
- Educate/manipulate it so that Customer requests have workflows as an owner

Take inspiration from [Getting Real](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdx5Dk3EWTe2i8YDA7bfl6g/playlists)

### Write the Press Release First

_In the modern world of business, it is useless to be a creative, original thinker unless you can also sell what you create_
