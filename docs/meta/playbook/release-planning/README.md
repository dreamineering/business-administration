PT Meeting Features [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZS9Kg0S2je1Gy9KCHfQdA1cTT5M66FBF8VMuNCp6ZSI/edit#gid=0)

## Questions

- What are the most valuable problems?
- How to test Riskiest Assumptions?
- Do we have resources?

## Problems

[position, position, position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blTNLVuRU6k)

- GPM is not just _Practice Management_ software
- GPM so big it takes a long time to understand all functionality
- Who cries last and loudest is not a way to run operations

## Goals

No more thinking of the product along Country or Windows v Web! Use [workflows](https://www.intercom.com/blog/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/) to understand how a feature connects customers to product benefits.

- Remove Silos
- Put place work into best workflows to give job context
- Have workflow owners, but not exclusive developers
- Owners of workflows should have Figma accounts
- Get faster better feedback from Customers before coding
- Educate/manipulate it so that Customer requests have workflows as an owner

Take inspiration from [Getting Real](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdx5Dk3EWTe2i8YDA7bfl6g/playlists)
