## Thought exercise

Focus on the pay off to the business owner, who like a physio patient probably does not understand the root cause of the problems they have.

1. Think of a practice business owner as a physio would an injured person
2. Think of that practice business owner as a loved one (child)
3. Considering their problems and goals
4. What goals outcomes in order would put that person on the path to happiness?
5. How can you explain it in their language? Knowing you can't be too direct with kids :)
6. Explain the idea to a kid, get them to explain it back.

- What emotion do you need to tap into or the psychological impact?
- How you want someone to feel? In the case of pain, avoid feeling.
- What you want them to think about?

A big part of our established target market is represented by Physios and the tend to be a **spirited** and **light-hearted** bunch.
