# Search Engine Optimisation

Optimize for search to increase traffic to your content over time from existing customers using search engines, and potential customers browsing the same topics.

Check the following:

- Filling in the metadata
- Tagging with appropriate keywords
- Optimising for a keyword string (if you have one in mind)
- Using h2 tags for subheadings
- Alt text for images

Create sharable quotes.

::: tip
Search through Job Boards looking for practice jobs on roles and responsibilities to get language and terms
:::

- Research roles
- Create the perfect spec for the role - two purposes
- Make sure we have a documented workflow for all jobs mentioned
- If not add to the backlog of content/development ideas
