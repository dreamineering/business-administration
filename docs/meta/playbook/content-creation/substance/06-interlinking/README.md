# Interlinking

Both existing and potential users arrive from different angles and they don’t necessarily understand how an article fits into the big picture.

Interlink documentation to help with content discovery, comprehension, and accessibility.

Areas to interlink content to

- Onboarding Phase
- Business Disciplines and Workflows
- User Roles and Jobs
- Operational Concepts / Domain Languge Glossary
- Functionality by Menu Area

Linking between your content builds a picture of the structure of your knowledge base in your user’s mind. By proxy, that will also be an impression of your product.

If writing an article in a series that needs to be read chronologically. Link to the previous and subsequent article for ease of navigation.

## Domain language glossary

Link from every term in your application's domain language that might not be univerally understood. For example Condition in GPM is often referred to as Case in other sytems.
