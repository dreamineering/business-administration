# Bullet lists and Subheadings

## Bullet lists

Lists are great for documentation because they improve usersâ€™ ability to scan. In a task-based article, numbered lists of steps are the best way to get your point across.

Review your article and ask yourself: is there any information that could be split up into a numbered list, rather than a chunky paragraph?

Things that could be split up into lists:

Steps
Alternative options
Configurations

## Subheadings

Use subheadings tp break up your text from being too long and help users scan your content more quickly to improve comprehension.

Subheadings should be around five words long and descriptive about the section. Each section should be no more than around three paragraphs, and each paragraph should contain no more than about three sentences.

Limit yourself to one subtopic per subheading
