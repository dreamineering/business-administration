## Intent

- Establish Thought Leadership
- Extract Value out of Support Centre
- Streamline sales to onboarding

Establish **Thought Leadership** by demonstrating knowledge of market challenges to growing a profitable practice while proving the cost of GPM is insignificant compared to the **opportunity costs** that come from inefficient and inaccurate workflows.

**How will this be achieved?** By explaining how primary KPIs feedback into a [forecasting tool](../../operations/finances/create-a-cashflow-forecast.md) that will serve as a Trojan Horse by helping owners plan for growth at the same time proving the benefits of functionality where they lack awareness of the business drivers.
