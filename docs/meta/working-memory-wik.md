## Brain Vomit

Email is open-loop communication

Time of day for deep work
time of day for tasks
time of day for clients

Why wait until the end of the day to do your business admin? Isn't this time when CEOs of other businesses have time available for treatment?

Use structured communication to create better work patterns for greater efficiency.

## Get off the Email Merry go round

- Email is an ineffective protocol for effective communication

## Practice Owners are like Farmers

- Need to extract value out of space and human resources
- don't let an asset become a competitor

## How much is business administration really costing you

## Why listen to podcasts

Hey mate

Cool will check out getting that stat to get time to discharge outcome from injury type.

The big thing here we have just learned is our booking system has a poor drop out rate. So the driving force of my efforts has been how to improve sales and marketing with an emphasis on the word indicator, not trying to replicate Xero which is about accounting cycle and legal compliance.

If we can solve the sales and marketing problem for our customers we will also solve our sales problems

That is why membership sales are so important, from a cash flow and market perspective, a good marketing strategy for a retail business should be converting customers to subscribed patients. Body Logic, for example, offers a free, running analysis appointment to try to convert clients into Running School members. From our perspective, we could set up an org with a membership or as more likely a recurring invoice.
Cash flow - fewer efforts chasing made debt as sales should be upfront and hence time-saving and write off reduction
Marketing - effectiveness of Running School campaign as an example

The other great thing about Gensolve here is we can link Front Desk staff to Membership Sales commissions another demand from the market when you listen to the podcasts linked below.

The future charges just look at next weeks bookings to give an indicator of whether a marketing and or sales push is required, the big value item for us / customers is web booking/total bookings where we have just learned from Physio Digital that our drop out rate is critically bad vs Cliniko as one example.

But we can / must also use Gensolve and online booking to book product demos or class webinars and from a booking, we can use email/letter templates to automate responses

If you look at the Telco diagram I was involved with a lot of reporting and decision/pricing algorithms, but with that the principle held of understanding effect on revenue and costs at a level accurate enough to make good decisions.

Revenue/charges by ledger is a natural by-product of setting a ledger on charges irrespective of accounting but the data can be passed into Xero or whatever they choose, the benefit is the ease of seeing physio, vs osteo, of private vs insurance by % of revenue as a check on marketing strategy. This is huge to someone like Paul Goss here who is trying to transition from Physio to a more rounded - virtuous cycle with income from pain => rehab => performance. Though I confess I don't understand the impact on Xero I assume it is neglible as you could still just use one ledger for the external accounting system. Really it is just an aggregation strategy.

Controversial

I mention the bank balance thing more as the is so much talk out there, and it is marketing channel we could leverage. But I don't concede this might be a stretch too far, I have set up some code in the front end to hide stuff if no results are returned

The budget won't be understood by most, but the key is to influence the influencers / would be business coaches and from listenning to these mastermind events they hold - creating an annual profit forecast is part of these workshops.

In the end words are cheap, I have been setting up Demo Practice on GPM UK to prove this stuff out. It would actually be pretty easy for me to set Matt or I am sure you could run the code to look at an organisation of your choice. You only need to hit a but and type one command
