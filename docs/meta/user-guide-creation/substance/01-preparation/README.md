## Preparation

Identify the relevant Workflow Diagram to understand overview of inputs and outputs and important interfaces to answer:

1. What primary business discipline?
2. What secondary business disciplines?
3. Which [audience](../audience/) is this content for? Why?
4. [When](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MiEWXA-JWk) is information relevant, and how frequently repeated?
5. How important/useful is information to remember?
6. What does success look like? What needs to be checked?
7. What screencasts should be add/linked?

When describing an activity that requires tasks with multiple form interfaces include a workflow diagram. An image is worth a thousand words, after all.

Make sure your images are not the only way you are conveying meaning. This is because images are not accessible, may not load, and may not be viewable on a small screen (mobile device) anyway.

Custom illustrations may not be within reach of everyone, but perhaps generating a diagram or screenshot might be possible.

If you include images, make sure each one has an ‘alt text’ tag filled in with a description of the image so screen readers can read it. This is an integral component of optimizing your knowledge base for SEO. We will cover this in-depth in a subsequent section
