# Accuracy

Documentation is going to become out of date.

Or did your engineering team release another version of the product while you were writing the docs, and forget to tell you?

You don’t want to tell your users to click on ‘funny widget’ when it’s actually now called ‘silly widget’. Inaccurate documentation breaks trust with users, and is arguably worse than none at all.

Factor potential inaccuracies into your content production process. Comb through your documentation deliberately looking for errors.

Pro tip: Ideally, your technical writers will work closely with developers using the docs like code methodology. This is where you keep your documentation in the same place as the source code. Technical writers and developers use the same tools, and docs are considered a condition before you can release code.
