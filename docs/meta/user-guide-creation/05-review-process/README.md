# Review Process

Good writing is mostly good editing. But we tend to skim-read personal writing and assume what’s there, making us miss errors. Team up with another person that has a different perspective on the subject to check the content makes sense and that instructions can be followed successfully.

## Check Styleguide

When you have more than one person writing knowledge base articles, it’s easy to end up with a bunch of different formats and styles. It’s confusing for users if you don’t have a coherent presentation and brand.

Even if you’re the lone technical writer, the person writing today is totally different to the person you were several months ago.

That’s why you should have a style guide for your knowledge base. This includes things like:

- Formatting (bold, italics, underlined, colours, fonts, links)
- Person (first, second or third)
- Capitalisations
- Headings
- Numbers
- Dates
- Oxford comma
- Acronyms
- Abbreviations
- Check that your article matches the style guide. If you don’t have a style guide, create one now!

## Consistency

Consistency is an important part of good writing in general, as well as successful branding. Your style guide should be the source for all your technical terms, product features, and other terminology.

It matters less how you choose to present your documentation than having consistency with your choices. This relates to your style guide but goes beyond style.

Some people will get annoyed with your stylistic, grammatical, formatting or word choices, but the most important thing is to keep them the same throughout.

For example, don’t say the number ‘4’ in one part of your knowledge base software, and ‘four’ in another. Don’t refer to your company as ‘The SaaS Company’ in one place, and ‘SaaS Company’ in another. You get the idea
