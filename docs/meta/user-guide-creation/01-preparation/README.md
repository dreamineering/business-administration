## Preparation

Find or create a relevant Workflow Diagram to understand inputs and outputs of the process flow

1. What is the main business discipline?
2. What related business discipline?
3. Which roles applicable to? Why?
4. How frequently?
5. What does success look like?
6. What needs to be checked?
7. What screencasts and screenshots exist?

When describing an activity that requires tasks with multiple form interfaces include a workflow diagram. An image is worth a thousand words, after all.

Make sure your images are not the only way you are conveying meaning. This is because images are not accessible, may not load, and may not be viewable on a small screen (mobile device) anyway.

Custom illustrations may not be within reach of everyone, but perhaps generating a diagram or screenshot might be possible.

If you include images, make sure each one has an ‘alt text’ tag filled in with a description of the image so screen readers can read it. This is an integral component of optimizing your knowledge base for SEO. We will cover this in-depth in a subsequent section
