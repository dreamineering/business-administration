Copywriting

1. encourage their dreams
2. justify their failures
3. allay their fears
4. confirm their suspicions
5. help them throw rocks at their enemies

Consider the emotion you want to tap into or the psychological impact.

Think about how you want someone to feel or what you want them to think about. In the case of pain, avoid feeling.

Focus on the pay off for the reader.
