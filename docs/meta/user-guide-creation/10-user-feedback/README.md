# User Feedback

Remember – you are not your audience. You’re so close to the product (and the documentation) that you have knowledge and insight your users are lacking.

If you have the time and resources, testing your documentation in front of actual users is the best measure of its efficacy. You can print out the pages of your content, or just the text, and ask users if they understand what it means. If you can’t get in front of real users, try doing it online.

Conducting a user research test will be very revealing in terms of your content’s usability. This may not be possible for every single article – or even most articles – but testing every so often will help keep you on track.

Pro tip: Watch out for the Hawthorne Effect – users will try to please the researcher when observed. The results you end up with may not always reflect actual usability.
