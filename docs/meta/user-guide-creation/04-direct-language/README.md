# Speak in plain language

Tools like Hemingway can help you make your writing as clear and easy to read as possible. You may even find out after using them regularly that plain writing becomes second nature.

Plain writing is not about making your writing boring. Plain writing is about clarity – which is exciting in its own way.

Consider the difference between these two sentences:

Make sure that you remember everything important when you leave, like your keys, phone and wallet.
Remember to take your keys, phone and wallet with you when you leave.
Read through your article and ask yourself: What are the possible interpretations here? If you can imagine more than one interpretation, refine your presentation and word choice until there is only one possible interpretation – the correct one.

How many separate bits of information must readers hold in their minds at once for your meaning to become coherent? Get right to the point in every sentence to remove the possibility of readers forgetting previous information, and becoming confused or disoriented.

Make your writing more plain by:

1. Choosing the most accurate, simple terms
2. Breaking your sentences down into only one or two clauses
3. Using correct punctuation like commas and dashes
4. Writing in a semi-formal conversation style
5. Deleting any unnecessary words.

## Eliminate Passive Voice

Passive voice is when you place the emphasis on the object rather than the subject.

Most sentences in English have a subject and a verb. The subject is who or what your sentence is about, and the verb describes an action or state of being.

Writing in the active voice means the subject is doing the action. The opposite is passive voice, when the subject is having the action done to them.

Most technical writers prefer to use active voice in documentation because it’s clearer and more direct. This is best illustrated with an example:

````ACTIVE VOICE: ‘the user [subject] clicks the button [object]

```PASSIVE VOICE: ‘the button [object] is clicked by the user [subject].’

The latter is much more wordy, and slower to read, than the former. Eliminate passive voice from your documentation as far as possible.
