# Search Engine Optimisation

Optimize for search to increase traffic to your content over time from existing customers using search engines, and potential customers browsing the same topics.

Check the following:

- Filling in the metadata
- Tagging with appropriate keywords
- Optimising for a keyword string (if you have one in mind)
- Using h2 tags for subheadings
- Alt text for images
