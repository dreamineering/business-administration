## Thought exercise

Focus on the pay off to the business owner, who like a physio patient probably does not understand the root cause of the problems they have.

1. Think of a practice business owner as a physio would an injured person
2. Think of that practice business owner as a loved one (child)
3. Considering common problems and goals
4. What goals outcomes in order would put that person on the path to happiness?

- What emotion do you need to tap into or the psychological impact?
- How you want someone to feel? In the case of pain, avoid feeling.
- What you want them to think about?
