A _Practice Manager_ is a composite of many other roles where a single person will **need to wear many hats** to meet the demands of the job at different times.

. Therefore these profiles are for _educational purposes_ to help to explore functionality within the context of the primary focus of each potential role in an organisation. When it comes to running your organisation **you have complete control** to [configure roles exactly as you desire](/features/system/security/).
