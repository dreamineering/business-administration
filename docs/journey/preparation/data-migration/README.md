# Data Migration

[[toc]]

1. Extract
2. Transform
3. Load

**Extract** your current supplier exports data and makes it available to you or a secure place we can access it.

**Transform** data from your old system is transformed into a format that can be used in GPM

**Load** transformed data is loaded into GPM. Depending on the size of your business this can take 30 mins to an entire weekend. Most migrations take approximately 2 hours to complete.

## Process

This is the process of getting your current supplier to extract your data, transfer that over to us so we can run the migration logic to set-up your organisation.

Below is a baseline critical path, dependent on workloads to respective parties. Note that some systems are much easier than others. **Note - we cannot confirm a GO LIVE date until your team confirms the migration logic is correct**. The items in bold below are your responsibility of your team.

1. **Request Approval data transfer with current software supplier**
2. Data dump received
3. Initial migration logic run (+0 Days)
4. **[Run through Approval Checklist](./approval-process) (+7-14 Days)**
5. **Approval Problems Feedback**
6. Run approval migration with fixes (+7 Days)
7. Repeat steps 3-5 until no issue
8. **Signoff migration logic**
9. Confirm Go Live date (+)
10. **Confirm LIVE data transfer Date with current software supplier**
11. Receive Live Data and run migration
12. Run Post Migration checklist
