# Growth

Not just financially but as humans.

Once you have fine-tuned your operational efficiency and communications you can hit the scale button, but should you grow **Organically** or **Acquisition**? Or a mixture of both?

## Questions

- Have you reached critical mass and operational intelligence to scale your business?
- What is the smartest way to grow given **end game** goals?
- Could you franchise your brand and operations?
- Are you planning to take over another organisation using GPM?
- Are you joining with other practices using GPM to create a new business?
- Are you leaving an existing practice using GPM to start a practice of your own?

## Goals

1. Make sure you are banking more money than you spend
2. Become very efficient with your time
3. Specialise in something that people need
4. Educate your target audience how you help them

## Plan
