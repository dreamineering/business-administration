# Time Blocking

**Time** is your greatest asset, don't waste it. As a business owner you need to remember you are managing a business, not working in a job. So the management of all aspects of the business should carry equal weight. Don't fall into the trap of doing what you comfortable **doing**, ignoring other important aspects of running a profitable business.

Not planning a schedule, committing to too many tasks or events, and dealing with the many life distractions can all lead to wasted time and anxiety about how to get things done.
