# Time Blocking for Success

**Timing** is a science, do yourself a massive favour and learn how to make the most of it!

> _There are predictable oscillations present in the days of our lives, and in individual and group work, that affect the outcomes we are working toward. We can improve our chances of success in work and life if we simply recognize these oscillations and use them to our advantage_ [When, Daniel Pink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn1gjO9yw6I)

## Do you value your time highly enough?

Not planning a schedule, committing to too many tasks or events, and dealing with the many life distractions can all lead to wasted time and anxiety about how to get things done.

As a business owner you need to remember you are leading a business, not working in a job. So all aspects of the business must carry equal weight. Don't fall into the trap of doing what you comfortable **doing**, ignoring other important aspects of running a profitable business.

## Color code your brain

Color code your brain by **theming** each day, hour. Time blocking system is when you schedule big blocks of time to make sure you dedicate enough time to complete any given task. You can take time blocking to the next level by assigning a specific color to each major discipline you need to give focus to.

## Deep Work versus Task Managagent versus Fighting Fires

Deep work is best early in the morning up until lunch time. You should do what you can to imerse yourself in a distraction free zone at this time.

::: tip
Unless you are working in Frontdesk Sales, only take inbound calls during the afternoon when your mind is better suited to task driven work.

## Planning

> _Why bother with such a detailed level of planning? My answer is simple: it generates a massive amount of productivity. A 40 hour time-blocked work week, I estimate, produces the same amount of output as a 60+ hour work week pursued without structure_ [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/)

Take time blocking **seriously**, dedicating ten to twenty minutes every evening to build your schedule for the next day. During this planning process consult your task lists and calendars, as well as my weekly and quarterly planning notes. Your goal is to make sure progress is being made on the right things at the right pace for the relevant deadlines.

## Set up recurring meetings

Schedule regular sales, marketing, and business best practices meetings with fixed agendas. Recurring meetings carve out a slot to talk about important issues that otherwise may not be prioritized properly if there’s no designated time

## Plan your week the week before

Study next week’s calendar **before Monday** rolls around. That way, you won’t step into any time block unprepared.

Frontloading your week with planning activities to ensure you are productive throughout the rest of the week. So if you have four priorities to accomplish next week:

- Schedules time on Friday of the previous week to analyze the tasks and prepare thoughts to tackle them.
- Schedules time to work on them the following week adding notes and any other research that is needed to tackle the task easily.

## Block personal time

Don’t be scared to sync your work and personal calendar. Planning time to exercise, meditate and prepare food etc is essential to to sharpen the saw and this is essential to the success of the business.

## Sync with your other Calendars

Copy the iCal link into your preferred personal calendar

## Create a baseline

- What jobs to you expect each employee to complete in a typical week?
- When is the best time to focus on completing those jobs?
- How long should they work on that job?
- What business discipline is the best category for the job?

1. Enter details into [your operations budget](../finances/create-a-cashflow-forecast.md)
2. Create appropriately named Clinician Appointment Types
3. In the Admin site **Block Out** time for Admin Staff to complete work as per forecast
4. In other Sites **Block Out** time for Clinicians to complete QA routines

## What to work on

The plans are intended to be dynamic.

1. Use Event naming convention to know what actions have greatest priority
2. As demands of the week require move appointment around
3. Each night check the discipline for the next day and ask yourself the best question you need to resolve to move the needle tomorrow.

## Closing Routine

- write down the most insightful question when closing the day before
- no Inbound Phones Call or Emails before lunchtime
- make important outbound phones calls early as possible
- save task-based work and [meetings](../effective-meetings.md) for the afternoon
- have a [close-down routine](/features/workflows/staff-management/how-to-create-operations-checklists/)

## Analysis

1. How much **Fire Fighting** (reactive time) ate into your plans?
2. What needs to be anchored for a particular time? Create Recurring Appointments.
3. Adjust your baseline forecast
4. Make a plan for next week

## Sample Plans

Take time blocking seriously, dedicating ten to twenty minutes every evening to building my schedule for the next day. During this planning process consult your task lists and calendars, as well as my weekly and quarterly planning notes. Your goal is to make sure progress is being made on the right things at the right pace for the relevant deadlines.

- Make Thursdays follow-up days and set aside Fridays for marketing.
- Blast out emails late on Sunday nights so they’re in people’s inboxes first thing Monday morning.
- Mondays are always hectic with follow-ups from the weekend and getting my staff ramped up and ready to go,
- Schedule time for deep thinking, make yourself uncontactable
- Id activities are fixed vs. flexible
- Schedule time away in a new environment for inspiration
- Schedule personal time, make it a priority to eat well and exercise

Before ending the day, review for your plan for tomorrow and ask the most insightful question you can, then leave it to your subconcious to process.
