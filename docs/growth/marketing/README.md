Most practices use an "**inside-out** approach to marketing in that they list their services based on skills and then look to sell to a vaguely defined group that is **out there**

However the **build it and they will come** approach usually results in wasted effort and failure. Before designing a product or service, business operators should study the market and assess the needs of customers. Find underserved areas. Then shape the marketing of the product or service, and sometimes the product or service itself, to answer those needs.
