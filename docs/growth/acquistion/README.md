# Growth by Acquisition

Accumulate talented service providers or under-performing assets.

In fractured allied health markets, GPM has enabled progressive clinics with the ability to fine-tune their operational intelligence and branding to grow organically or by acquisition

## GPM to GPM Migrations

We've helped many practices to leverage having a centralised administration team to realise the benefits of economies of scale.

Compared to the headaches that have to be accepted with most mergers. The beautiful thing with a _G2G migration_ is that from one day to the next your operations remain the same, leaving your team free to focus on customer service not boring administration tasks.
