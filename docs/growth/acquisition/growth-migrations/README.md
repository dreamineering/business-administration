# Gensolve to Gensolve Migrations

We've helped many practices to leverage having a centralised administration team to realise the benefits of economies of scale.

Compared to the headaches that come with most business mergers, the beautiful thing with a _G2G migration_ is that from one day to the next your operations remain the same, leaving your team free to focus on customer service not boring administration tasks.
