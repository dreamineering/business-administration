Practice business administrators generally **need to wear many hats**. Therefore these profiles are for _educational purposes_ to help to explore functionality within the context of the primary focus of each potential role in an organisation. When it comes to running your organisation **you have complete control** to [configure roles exactly as you desire](../features/system/security/).
