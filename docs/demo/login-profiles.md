## Example Roles

Within your own organisation **you have complete flexibility** to configure roles as you desire.

| Username  |     Display Name     |                 Focus |
| --------- | :------------------: | --------------------: |
| clinician |      Clinician       |      Client Treatment |
| fd        |      Front Desk      |          Client Sales |
| om        |  Operations Manager  |   Business Operations |
| ap        |  Accounts & Payroll  |   Business Operations |
| lc        |    Lead Clinician    |   Business Operations |
| acc       |      Accountant      | Professional Services |

| mm        |  Marketing Manager   | Professional Services |
| gpm       |      GPM Admin       |      GPM Configration |
| cfb       | Custom Forms Builder |      GPM Configration |

For newcomers, taking in all of GPM's functionality at once can be confusing. Below is a diagram that breaks roles by their primary focus, so you can log into the application and understand the features through different perspectives.

::: tip
If you hold down the shift key then click on the GPM application in the bottom task bar of windows you can log in with the manager profile, so you can view full functionality.

Once you are successfully logged in choose an appropriate [demonstration to follow](../demonstration/) to learn the essentials.
