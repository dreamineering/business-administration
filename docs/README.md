## [Practice Journey](./practice-journey/)

- Always have a plan for the week ahead
- Replace your vicious cycles with virtuous
- Reactive time with constructive time
- Take yourself out of range, schedule time for deep thinking
- Empty your head, know what needs to be done when the time is right

If your patients don’t establish positive habits by following routines you provide them, would you expect successful treatment outcomes? We are not here to run your business, but when you start with GPM we can set-up your configuration to give you a headstart on growing your operational intelligence and profits.
