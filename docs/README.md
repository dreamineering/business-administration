With Gensolve you get four business applications for the price of one, where the business model you can support is only limited by your imagination.

## Quality of Treatment

Our Patient Records allow you to **deliver and measure the effectiveness of your plan of care** with all a patient information efficiently recorded and stored in one place.

GPM has extensive clinical notes out of the box, where **each clinician** can completely customise their optimum treatment pathway.

- Treatment and Analysis plans
- Customisable Text Shortcuts
- General Health and Patient History
- Goal and Full Medical History Reports
- Document and Video uploads
- Referrals, Investigations and Discharges

Subjective charts are used to display standard body diagrams (or other images depending on specialty) and can easily be drawn on by the practitioner. Notes can be edited or extended on the day. With state-of-the-art audit trails and security features, GPM ensures that once recorded, patient notes cannot be tampered with.
