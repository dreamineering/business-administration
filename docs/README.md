## Practice Journey

If your patients donâ€™t establish postive habits based on following routines you provide them, would you expect successful outcomes at the conclusion their treatment plan?

**Our focus is product improvement** rather than guiding you how to run your business. But we have provided thoughts on how key workflows can be implemented with GPM that you can fine tune to optimise your operational intelligence and profits. If you need help priortising what jobs will lead to optimum value creation, we will happily introduce you to [business coaches](./practice-journey/growth/coaching/) that specialise in this area.
