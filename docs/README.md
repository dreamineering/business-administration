**Take the pain out of running your business and start growing value or spend the time you save with those you love.**

If your patients donâ€™t establish postive habits by following routines you provide them, would you expect successful treatment outcomes?

Just as you can't enforce how you customer's live their lives, we are not here to run your business. But have documented ideas on how key workflows can be implemented with Gensolve Practice Manager that you can copy and then optimise to grow your operational intelligence and profits.

If you need help priortising what jobs will lead to optimum value creation, we will happily introduce you to those in our [professional network](./practice-journey/growth/coaching/) that specialise in your area of need.
