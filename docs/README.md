**Treating a dysfunctional business is much the same as treating a dysfunctional body it is just the names of the problems that differ. Both have subjective and objectives perspectives of what the real problem is. The key to success with both is to get honest about the problem and then build positive routines and habits that will drive successful outcomes on the journey of constant improvement.**

Every business requires accurate profit forecasts as few investors will put money into your dreams if you're unable to provide a set of thoughtful forecasts. More important, proper financial forecasts will help you develop operational and staffing plans that will help make your business a success.

## Finances

Track cashflow through to your balance sheet with your accountant without leaving the application. Strong financial controls are fundamental to the success of any business. With Gensolve your Accountant can directly implement real-time value by guiding how to configure your ledgers for better analysis of results versus your growth strategy. [Invite your accountant](/roles/accountant.md) to take look. If your accountant already uses [Xero](https://www.xero.com/) no problems, Gensolve has [integration](/features/integrations/) covered.

## Marketing

Since marketing and sales will generate revenue, you need to understand your target customers and determine how you will reach them. Most practices use an "**inside-out** approach to marketing in that they list their services based on skills and then look to sell to a vaguely defined group that is **out there**

The **build it and they will come** approach usually results in wasted effort and failure. Assess the needs of your intended client's bearing in mind that upwards of 80% of them are likely to come from within a 10km radius.

## Do It Your Way

Just like Frank you can leave your regrets behind and take complete control of your patient experience and run your business exactly how you want. With full support for multi-disciplinary clinics, GPM enables customisation that enable:

Clinical Directors to:

- plan the optimum journey to follow for quality control of treatment plans
- capture objective, subjective, specific injury or rehabilitation type analysis

Operations Managers to capture:

- Patient (GDPR) Consent
- Measure Staff Engagement

Marketing Managers to capture:

- Net Promoter Scores and Testimonial Surveys
- Friends and Family referrals

Financial Managers to budget operating margin with contract charges for established plans of care.

## Control

_If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it, if your processes are inconsistent, what you measure is boll... not much use_

Track performance, connect the dots, close the loop, review your strategy and adjust your plans to take control of your destiny.
