ACC (New Zealand)

Electronic Billing to ACC for appointment and other miscellaneous charges is a seamless function within Gensolve’s practice management software. Once the appointments or charges are completed and meet the billing criteria, a simple process creates an electronic file that can be processed by the ACC website. This removes the need for time consuming and expensive paper invoices. On payment, remittance advices can also be easily uploaded into Gensolve Practice Manager, automatically matching items being paid.

Gensolve Practice Manager monitors and tracks injury treatment allowances and time frames for each injury ensuring timely and accurate control of the allowed treatment profiles, pro-actively alerting to potential treatment extension approvals.
