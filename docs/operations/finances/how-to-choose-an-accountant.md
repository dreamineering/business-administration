# How to choose an accountant

Picking the right accountant is a vital business decision, so you’ll need to arm yourself with the right assessment questions.

Choosing the right accountant is one of the most important decisions a small business can make. A good one can save you time and help your business grow; a bad one could cost you much needed money. Yet with thousands to choose from, it can be a daunting call to make. So when it comes to selecting and working with an accountant, what are the questions every small business owner should ask so as to make the most informed choice?

1. Why should I hire you?
2. Could my money work harder?
3. Are we a good match?
4. Who needs to do what, when?

## Questions

### Why should I hire you?

Hiring an accountant can be **even more important** than taking on a member of staff.

the key thing to query during the hiring process is how the accountant will add financial value to your company. “Look for someone who can act as a business partner. You want them to demonstrate the skills and knowledge of supporting a small business.”

Meet with a least three candidates before making a final choice.

### Could my money work harder?

### Are we a good match?

### Who needs to do what, when?

## Operational Decisions

### Are things working out?

## Do you need help
