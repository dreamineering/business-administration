## Anchoring

Give your customer's a frame of reference for valuing your product.

- Sell memberships
- Create a tiered pricing strategy
- Online booking should be for initial appointments

| Appointment      | Cost               |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Calendar Booking | Higher             |
| 5 Treatments     | Discounted         |
| 10 Treatments    | Further discounted |

4 appointments cost
