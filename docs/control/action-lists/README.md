# Action Reports

These reports direct your staff to tasks they need to complete to satisfy business rules in GPM to avoid losing customers or maintaining your quality of service standards.

You can think of them as system-generated TODO lists, but where the user that owns the problem must take relevant corrective action in GPM to remove themselves from the naughty list.

## Rules

1. bad news need to travel fast
2. show the worst news first
3. staff are doing their job they won't be seen

## Types of actions

1. Close system procedure gaps
2. Report benchmark performance failures
3. Trigger strategic decisions
