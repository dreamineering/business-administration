# Conditions

As best practice should be used to describe the condition of a patient at a **certain period of time** typically with one clinician. Using conditions a patient journey would be made up of series conditons and broken down by taking a customer from one clearly defined state to another (Pain Relief, Stabalisation, Strengthen)

Conditions are most suited to retail operations with lower patient retention.

- Should be tied to clearly understood treatment goal
- Goal related to a step improvment
- Goal typically achieveable within 6 weeks

## Financials

Compared to [contracts](../contracts/) there no obligation that the client will complete the full course of treatment

## Scerario

Knee is in pain.

## Action Reports

- Conditions without Plans

## Contract or Condition?

If well known path to treatment success with strongly marketed package of care? Then use contracts, when template plans will be setup in advance. If treatment is more ad hoc responding to patient issue that is presented during the initial appointment then use conditions.
