# Action Reports

AKA Naughty lists, these reports highlight system process gaps and supplement Events as todo lists where each user should check and close on a routine basis.

The strength of acton lists over a TODO action is that the user that owns the problem must take relevant corrective action in GPM to close the item correctly and remove themselves from the naughty list.

Action reports don't require analysis as this intelligence is in GPM, instead they direct users, based on their role, to the most valuable action they need to take to ensure smooth and profitable operations.

Action reports must be backed by strong operations workflows that detail how even inexperienced staff can complete a triggered scenario without managerial guidance.
