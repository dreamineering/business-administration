title: Control Loops

# Control Loops

Track, connect the dots, close the loop, attribute, summarize and overview. How often do you say youâ€™re going to do these things

Types:

1. Action lists
2. Predictive

## Action Lists

Based on fundamental truths, identify problems rectify with documented workflows

## Predictive

If we do this, then we **should** get that.

To be capable of knowing the future would be a great magical superpower. Unfortunately, we can't provide magic, but predicting the future is a skill you can develop and is vital to leading a thriving business. All you need is accurate data, and a consistent method based on solid reasoning you can continously evolve. Sometimes the value of results will be out, but the value of thinking ahead is still something you can bank.

Sometimes actions are clear and obvious, others require a coffee and a stroll around the park. Different types of dashboard exist in GPM to provide a singular focus where prevention is better than cure.

> Imagine if each team member of your business knew the single most valuable action they need to take **right now**?

## Prevention is better than cure

1. What situations need to be fixed immediately?
2. Does the outlook for next week look good/bad?
3. Who had a good/bad week|month|qsuarter?

## [Action Reports](./action-reports/)

Refer to frequently to identify:

- incorrect application use
- clients that require sales calls
- gaps in business procedures
- staff that are underperforming

## [Key Performance Indicators](./kpis/)

The keyword here is **Indicator** are these numbers are subjective and require further analysis to understand the bigger picture of how they occurred. For example, returning the Saturation percentage for each clinician is not as valuable as returning those whose Saturation is under 70% in order of lowest to highest. This will give you a list of Clinicians to speak with in critical order but won't tell you why their numbers are low. For that you will need to dig into other reports to get a complete picture. Such questions as:

1. has the Clinician been acting on their Discharge or Rebook report actions?
2. has the Clinician been Follow Report actions?
3. is this a new Clinician with a low base of returning clients?

### Sales and Marketing

1. is the Clinician at a newly started site?
2. is the Clinician is offering a service that is new to the clinic?
3. lack of intra-referrals from other staff?

### Quality

The Clinician treated an unusually high number of Clients with an injury where either they or the clinic needs to improve the treatment pathway.

## [Expectations](./expectations/)

Set targets that drive action or strategic decisions to be made. To help with setting expectations you should regularly review a profit forecast spreadsheet where you can run scenario analysis.
