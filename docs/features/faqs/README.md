## How do I email a report to a clincian?

Don't, it is better to setup a recurring event for reports that clinicians need to run on a regular basis. If you find a clincian is ignoring the reminder to run these reports you can choose to set the **pop up reminder**. Or more serious create a **WARNING** event for that clinician with a reminder to run their reports.

The advantage of doing this over email is that as a manager you can run this report again during an in-service peformance review.
