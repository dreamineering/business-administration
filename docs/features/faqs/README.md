## How do I email a report to a clincian?

**Don't!** It is better to setup a recurring event to remind clinicians of important tasks they need to complete. If you find a clincian is ignoring the reminder, you can choose to set the **pop up reminder** or for repeat offendors create an official **WARNING** event to remind them of run their reports.

The advantage of doing this over email is that as a manager you can run this report again during an in-service peformance review.
