- Supports multiple trading vendors, to do the equivalent with Xero as an example requires three separate subscriptions/accounts
- Custom Contracts to support Packaged Care
- Workflow Templates
- Debt Recovery Plans

We also have an Audiology product that runs New Zealand's biggest Audiology business and software that runs a successful trailer hire business in Australia.

We've got organisational smarts within business services too.
